2018012.0616: I did the basics. thread example, plot example. I will use pyqtgraph for the plotting. 
			  I need the basInitializer be finished. There should be a thread at start time.
			  initializer should start first.
			  initializer will check whether it is the first time that application is being run.
			  if yes, initialize the db after that starts other threads. if no, just start threads.
